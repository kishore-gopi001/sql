A Relational Schema specifies: the name of a relation, and the attributes.
A Relational Instance is a table made up of the attributes, or columns, and the tuples,
or rows.
Degree refers to the number of attributes, or columns, in a relation.
Cardinality refers to the number of tuples, or rows in a relation.
You can now define the relational terms: relation, degree, and cardinality, and, explain the
difference between a relational schema and a relational instance.
